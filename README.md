# OpenCV_Notes
Used to record the learning record of the opencv

In order to record my own study notes on computer vision open source library, OpenCV, 

the serial number in front of the file name represents the order of learning, 

following the rules from simple to complex, each folder contains the code and images folder,

code storage The code implemented by the corresponding module can be directly copied and run,

and the images contain the pictures used by each module.

If you are interested in the principles of the algorithm, or would like to know more, please visit my blog or email me.
